2022 Shanghai Covid19 data analysis

All data points come from Shanghai Municipal Health Commission (http://wsjkw.sh.gov.cn/yqtb/index.html), from 24th Feb to 12th April so far. 

It is just an data analysis practice, I did not interprete the data or make any further prediction. 

The Rmarkdonw output file (html) includes both Chinese and English description.
